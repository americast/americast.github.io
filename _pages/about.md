I am a PhD student at Georgia Tech College of Computing, advised by [Prof Joy Arulraj](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~jarulraj/) and [Prof B. Aditya Prakash](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~badityap/). My research focus is `Time Series Forecasting`, i.e., given a series of data points ordered in time, I look into the best possible ways of estimating the value or interval of the data during the next few time steps.

Forecasting has a variety of use cases, like predicting how the weather would be in the next few hours, or estimating flu cases for the next few weeks. I work on improving forecasting from different fronts -- from making better machine learning models to attempting to aid a user towards picking the right tool to use for forecasting. Check out some of my [projects](/projects/) to get more insights about my works!

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
